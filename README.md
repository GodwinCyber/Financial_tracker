## Team Members

- **Godwin Chukwuma:** Full Stack
### Justification for Roles

The original plan for this project was to collaborate with a partner. However, partway through, my partner realized that his scores fell below the threshold required to proceed to the final project. As a result, I decided to take full responsibility for the project, applying everything I have learned during my time in the ALX Africa Full Stack Software Engineering program.

### Trade-offs and Decisions

- React vs. Vue.js: Chose React for its robust ecosystem and component-based architecture.
- Tailwind CSS vs. Bootstrap: Preferring Tailwind for flexibility and customization.
- Tailwind CSS vs. Traditional CSS: Tailwind CSS offers UI development with predefined classes.
- Honojs vs Express:  Evaluating lightweight speed and modern features of Hono.js against the established robustness and flexibility of Express.
- neondb and drizzle over SQL: Leveraging the cutting-edge capabilities of NeonDB and Drizzle as modern alternatives to traditional SQL databases.

## Challenge Statement

Seamlessly creating a frontend despite my backend specialization, connecting with external APIs, and managing API interactions through Hono.js while effectively integrating the endpoint with the API call.

### Scope Limitations

The project does not address copyright issues or broader industry challenges, instead focusing solely on enhancing the user's ability to manage their day-to-day financial tasks more effectively.

### Target Audience

Everyoneâ€”financial literacy is essential for all. This project aims to help individuals track their daily financial activities, empowering them to make informed decisions and improve their financial literacy.
